                        <p class="job-description">The Medical First Response Central Team will serve as a backup
                            medical team, on top of our
                            St. John Ambulance Medical First Response partner. The responders will primarily be staffed
                            within
                            the First Aid station located adjacent/within the central information directory, and will be
                            deployed if
                            St.John Ambulance volunteers request additional professional healthcare support. In

                            responders will respond to additional medical emergencies if St.John Ambulance volunteers

                            unable to reach the casualty due to an ongoing medical emergency. It is expected that if
                            St.John
                            Ambulance volunteers determine that the situation of the medical emergency is beyond the

                            Medical First Responder, the Central Team will be able to take over control of the scene and
