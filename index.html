                    Modelled after LavaMae’s Pop-Up Care Village in the San Francisco Bay Area, the Calgary Pop-Up Care
                    Village is a festival for anyone experiencing systemic vulnerabilities such as homelessness and
                    addiction. We provide equitable access to basic services such as case management, healthcare,
                    clothing,
                    haircuts, food and more to the street. This event is a one-day event that upholds guests' inherent
                    human
                    dignity, and bridges the wider Calgarian community with the underserved population.
